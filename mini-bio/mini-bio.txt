Mini-Biography:
==============
Classes can sometimes feel so impersonal!  We created this mini-bio so we may get to know each other a little better. 
This will be kept confidential amongst the staff, but you don't have to fill in anything you don't wish to.

** The staff will answer them too, so how about you? **


--> Where did you grow up? What was your academic path?
(e.g. Did you live in the same town all your life or did you move around; and if so, where? Did you go to community college or another school before this one?)

I was born in Seoul, South Korea; however, when I was 3, due to my parents work, I immigrated to Brazil. For almost 19 years, my family and I stayed in Sao Paulo where I studied in an international school. From there on, I graduated from highschool and ended up here at Berkeley. Looking back, it was a wonder how I was able to attend the same school for 13 years, starting since kindergarten until graduation, but I think it played a cruel role in developing my interests toward engineering. Not only did the school have many extracurricular activities that I could indulge in, it also allowed the liberty for the student to pursue their interests to a certain degree by offering a education similar to college where the students are able to select their own courses from a list. Obviously, I leaned towards mathematics and physics, realizing the my interest towards history and literature was superficial. Through that I had decided to come here to Berkeley and look forward to being a part of the EECS department.

--> How much programming have you done (and what languages)?

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I had rare any to almost no experience with programming; however, coming here, I took CS61A and CS61B, learning both python and Java.

--> What are your hobbies?

I could say that my hobbies range from sports, such as basketball and soccer, to playing the saxophone and the violin. I would say that I don't have that many hobbies other than the ones I had listed, but I do indulge heavily in them. I also do like going out and hanging out with my friends and relaxing. If I had to state one more thing I really like, it would be that I enjoy being in the water. Usually I would relax with a few friends in a jacuzzi and relieve the stress that I had built up until then. 

--> What are some of your talents and skills?

Obviously, from the previous question, I enjoy playing basketball and soccer, which would say that I am, to a certain point, athletic. Also, I play multiple instruments such as the saxophone, the clarinet, the violin, the piano, and the guitar. Other than these, I speak 3 languages, which are Portuguese, English, and Korean, excluding the fact that I do understand a lot of Spanish for how it is so similar to Portuguese (Yes, Brazil speak Portuguese and not Brazilian).

--> Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything really memorable happened to you?
(e.g. travel, meeting famous people, 15 min of fame, inventions, overcoming adversity, etc.)

The most interesting thing that I had done in the past 2 years was an Euro trip that I went on for 2 weeks starting from Paris and ending in Venice. Following this, I enlisted in the Korean Army due to mandatory military service for the country. Due to this, I took a 2 year leave from college after my first year and now I am finally returning.

--> What commitments will be consuming your cycles this term?
(e.g. classes, jobs, family, commutes, volunteering, sports, student groups, etc.)

Most of my commitments would be my classes. Getting back from the military, I still have to readjust to the college experience and launch into my classes again. Other than that, I frequently go down to RSF to play basketball and would meet a few friends during the weekend. Other than that, I hope to have a great year here at Berkeley.
